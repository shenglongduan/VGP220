//TODO: This question is optional. It's bonus if you don't search or copy anything from the internet.
//There are no wrong answers. Interview questions like this one is just to evaluate how you think.
//Of course that you can find this question on the internet, but try not to. Think about what is the worst case scenario.
//and how can you make this better.

//Question 6: EA's and Google's Interview question

//You work in a 100 floor building and you get 2 identical eggs.
//You need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking.
//Find an algorithm that is minimizing number of throws in the worst-case scenario.
//Code is not necessary. You can explain with your own words.
//You can make some assumptions like:
//1)If an egg doesnâ€™t break when dropped from some floor, then it will not break when dropped from any lower floors.
//2)An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
//3)A broken egg must be discarded.
//4)The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
//5)If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.

// step1: set start = 1
// step1: set end = 100
// step3: drop the egg from mid = (start+end)/2
// step4: if the egg break
// step5:    set end = mid
// step6: else:
// step7:    set start = mid
// step8: if start==end and egg not break, exit loop,
// step9: goto step 3
